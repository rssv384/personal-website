# PersonalWebsite

My personal website that serves as a portfolio of my personal work as a Software Engineer.

This project was built using:

- Angular
- Firebase
  - Firestore
  - Cloud Storage
  - Hosting
- EmailJS

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
